# Select a more energy efficient AI/ML framework

## Description
Training an AI model implies a significant carbon footprint. The underlying framework used for the development, training, and deployment of AI/ML needs to be evaluated and considered to ensure the process is as energy efficient as possible.

Typically, AI/ML frameworks built on languages like C/C++ are more energy efficient than those built on other programming languages.


## Solution
Evaluate and select an energy-efficient framework/module for AI/ML development, training and inference. 

## SCI Impact
`SCI = (E * I) + M per R`

[Software Carbon Intensity Spec](https://grnsft.org/sci)

Selecting an energy-efficient AI/ML would impact SCI as follows:
- `E`: Having an energy-efficient framework reduces energy consumption for AI/ML training and inference and consequently.

## Assumptions
None 

## Considerations
None
