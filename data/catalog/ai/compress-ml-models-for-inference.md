# Optimize the size of AI/ML models

## Description

Large-scale AI/ML models require significant storage space and take more resources to run as compared to optimized models.


## Solution
Optimizing the size of the AI/ML model can save on storage space and take up less memory. Apply strategies like quantization and evaluate the optimization changes against the desired accuracy.


## SCI Impact
`SCI = (E * I) + M per R`

[Software Carbon Intensity Spec](https://grnsft.org/sci)

Optimizing the AI/ML model impacts SCI as follows:
- `E`: Having an optimized AI model would reduce the energy consumption for your AI/ML inference, save storage space and network bandwidth and consequently, the E number should decrease.

## Assumptions
None 

## Considerations
None
